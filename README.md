# üåç Physics-Aware Consistency Evaluator (PACE)

**PACE toolkit** provides a set of diagnostics to evaluate the **physical consistency** of machine learning-based Earth system predictions. It helps verify whether models like **GraphCast** (global) and **CorrDiff** (regional downscaling) respect fundamental physical laws across space, time, and variables.

## üí° Why PACE?

Machine learning forecasts can appear statistically accurate while violating basic physical relationships (e.g., pressure-wind imbalance, unphysical temperature fields). **PACE** provides a framework to:

- Assess **multivariate physical consistency**
- Evaluate **spatial/temporal coherence**
- Compare ML outputs against physically grounded baselines
